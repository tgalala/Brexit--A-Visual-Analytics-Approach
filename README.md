Brexit: A Visual Analytics Approach

Author: Tareq Galala

Abstract: In this paper, we look at the 2016 referendum results data. 
First, will be visually exploring the spatial distributions for different variables from the 2011 U.K. census that we assume to be 
discriminating, aggregated to local authority level and we will identify the key drivers in England behind the leave vote and compare 
it with London. Second, will be looking into patterns and relationships using a visual analytics approach. 
And third, we will use regression analysis to capture how did different ethnics votein different regions of England 
using national identity and what characteristics they hold. We will showcase a combination of visual techniques
and computational methods across this paper.
