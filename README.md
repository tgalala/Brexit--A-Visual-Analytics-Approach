# Brexit: A Visual Analytics Approach


2016 referendum results data 

First, will be visually exploring the spatial distributions for different variables from the 2011 U.K. census that we assume to be discriminating, aggregated to local authority level and we will identify the key drivers in England behind the leave vote and compare it with London.

Second, will be looking into patterns and relationships using a visual analytics approach. 

Third, we will use regression analysis to capture how did different ethnics votein different regions of England using national identity and what characteristics they hold. We will showcase a combination of visual techniquesand computational methods across this paper.
